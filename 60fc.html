      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: how energy flows through an ecosystem using food chains, and how predator–prey population cycles work.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Food Chains and Food Webs</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>food chain</strong> shows <strong>what gets eaten by what</strong> in an ecosystem.</li>
          <li>It is a <strong>simplified version of a food web</strong>, because it only shows one pathway of feeding.</li>
          <li>Food webs are more complex and show <strong>many different feeding relationships</strong> in an ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Producers – The Start of All Food Chains</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>All food chains start with a <strong>producer</strong>.</li>
          <li>Producers are <strong>photosynthetic organisms</strong>, such as green plants or algae.</li>
          <li>They can produce <strong>glucose by photosynthesis</strong>, using <strong>energy from the Sun</strong>.</li>
          <li>We can use <strong>grass</strong> as a simple example of a producer in a food chain.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Biomass – Stored Energy in Organisms</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When producers make biological molecules like sugars, these become part of the plant&apos;s <strong>biomass</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Biomass</strong> is the mass of living material and represents <strong>stored energy</strong>.</li>
          <li>Energy from the Sun is therefore <strong>stored in the biomass</strong> of the producer and passed on when the producer is eaten.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Consumers</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The next organisms in the food chain are the <strong>primary consumers</strong>.</li>
          <li>Primary consumers eat the producers (for example, <strong>mice eating grass</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary consumers</strong> feed on primary consumers and are often <strong>predators</strong> (such as an <strong>owl eating mice</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Tertiary consumers</strong> are the <strong>third level of consumers</strong> in the chain.</li>
          <li>Some ecosystems have more levels, others fewer.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Energy Transfer and Arrow Direction</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>As we move up the food chain, energy is transferred from <strong>one level to the next</strong>.</li>
          <li>However, <strong>most of the energy is lost</strong> between each level.</li>
          <li>For example, about <strong>1,000 J</strong> of energy in grass might give only about <strong>100 J</strong> to mice and around <strong>20 J</strong> to an owl.</li>
          <li>In diagrams, the <strong>arrows</strong> between organisms show the <strong>direction of energy flow</strong> (from the food to the organism that eats it).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Interactions in Ecosystems</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the most important ideas in ecology is that <strong>organisms interact and influence each other</strong>.</li>
          <li>Changes in the population of one species can affect the populations of <strong>other species</strong>.</li>
          <li>Predators and their prey often show linked patterns over time.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Predator–Prey Cycles</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>predator–prey cycle</strong> shows how the populations of a predator and its prey change over time.</li>
          <li>In the example, the prey is the <strong>field mouse</strong> and the predator is the <strong>owl</strong>.</li>
          <li>Both populations <strong>cycle up and down</strong> rather than staying constant.</li>
          <li>The predator population changes always <strong>lag behind</strong> the prey population slightly.</li>
          <li>Because of this lag, the cycles are said to be <strong>out of phase</strong> with each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Phase 1 – Low Predator, Rising Prey</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>At first, the <strong>owl population is low</strong>.</li>
          <li>With few predators, the <strong>mouse population can increase</strong> because fewer mice are being eaten.</li>
          <li>This leads to a <strong>peak</strong> in the prey population later on.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Phase 2 – More Prey, Then More Predators</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When there are now <strong>many mice</strong>, there is <strong>plenty of food</strong> for the owls.</li>
          <li>The predator population (owls) then begins to <strong>increase</strong>.</li>
          <li>Eventually, there are <strong>too many predators</strong>, and they eat a lot of the mice.</li>
          <li>This causes the <strong>mouse population to decline</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Phase 3 – Falling Predator Numbers and Repeating Cycles</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>With fewer mice around, there is now <strong>less food</strong> for the owls.</li>
          <li>The owl population then begins to <strong>decline</strong> as well.</li>
          <li>With fewer predators again, the <strong>mouse population can rise</strong> once more.</li>
          <li>This brings the system back to a similar starting point, so the <strong>cycle repeats</strong> again and again.</li>
          <li>The key reason for the cycles is that <strong>populations take time to increase or decrease</strong>, often over several generations.</li>
        </ul>
