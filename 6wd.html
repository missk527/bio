        <summary>What is diffusion?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Diffusion is the <em>net</em> movement of particles from an area of <strong>higher concentration</strong> to an area of <strong>lower concentration</strong>.</li>
          <li>It occurs because particles move <strong>randomly</strong>. They do not “aim” for low concentration; spreading out is the overall result of chance movement.</li>
          <li>When many particles start bunched together, they gradually <strong>spread out</strong> until they are roughly <strong>evenly distributed</strong> in the available space.</li>
          <li>“<strong>Net movement</strong>” means considering the group overall: individual particles can move either way at any moment, but overall flow is from high → low concentration.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Where does diffusion happen?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In <strong>gases</strong> (e.g., a sprayed perfume smell moving across a whole room).</li>
          <li>In <strong>liquids/solutions</strong> (e.g., food colouring dispersing in a beaker until the colour is uniform).</li>
          <li>Across <strong>partially permeable membranes</strong> such as cell membranes.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Diffusion through cell membranes</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Cell membranes are <strong>partially permeable</strong>: only some molecules can cross by diffusion.</li>
          <li>Typically, <strong>small dissolved molecules</strong> diffuse through: water, glucose, amino acids (also gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide).</li>
          <li><strong>Large molecules</strong> (e.g., <em>proteins</em>, <em>starch</em>) are too big to pass by simple diffusion.</li>
          <li>Diffusion is a <strong>passive</strong> process—no energy from the cell is required.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Factors affecting the rate of diffusion</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Concentration gradient:</strong> bigger difference in concentration → faster diffusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> higher temperature gives particles more kinetic energy → faster random motion → faster diffusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Surface area:</strong> larger membrane surface area → more particles can cross at once → faster diffusion.</li>
