      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Causes of plant disease</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Plants can get diseases from microorganisms such as <strong>fungi</strong>, <strong>bacteria</strong>, and <strong>viruses</strong>.</li>
          <li>They can also be harmed by larger organisms such as <strong>insects</strong> (e.g., aphids, spider mites).</li>
          <li>Plants may also develop <strong>deficiency diseases</strong> if they lack essential mineral ions (e.g., <strong>nitrates</strong>, <strong>magnesium ions</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Nitrate deficiency</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nitrates</strong> are needed to make <strong>amino acids and proteins</strong> (important for growth).</li>
          <li>Plants lacking nitrates often show <strong>stunted growth</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Magnesium deficiency</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Magnesium ions</strong> are needed to make <strong>chlorophyll</strong>.</li>
          <li>Without enough chlorophyll, photosynthesis is reduced and leaves may turn yellow (<strong>chlorosis</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Common symptoms of disease</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Abnormal growths or lumps</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Malformed stems or leaves</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Patches of decay</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Spots/discolouration</strong> on leaves.</li>
          <li>Sometimes you can directly see pests such as <strong>aphids</strong> or <strong>spider mites</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Diagnosing plant disease</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with <strong>basic observations</strong> and match symptoms to a <strong>garden manual</strong> or reputable website.</li>
          <li>If unsure, send a sample to a <strong>plant pathologist</strong> for detailed testing.</li>
          <li>Possible tests include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Microscopy</strong> of tissue samples.</li>
              <li>Testing for pathogen <strong>antigens</strong> (e.g., using <strong>monoclonal antibodies</strong>).</li>
              <li><strong>DNA tests</strong> to detect pathogen DNA.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A simpler method is <strong>trial and error</strong> (e.g., add magnesium if you suspect deficiency; use antifungal sprays if fungal disease is suspected).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Plant defences</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Plant defences can be grouped into <strong>physical</strong>, <strong>chemical</strong>, and <strong>mechanical</strong> defences.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Physical defences (barriers)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Waxy cuticle</strong> on leaves/stems helps prevent pathogen entry.</li>
          <li><strong>Cellulose cell walls</strong> around each cell.</li>
          <li>Layers of <strong>dead cells</strong> such as <strong>bark</strong> around stems.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Chemical defences</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Plants can secrete <strong>antimicrobial substances</strong> that kill bacteria/fungi.</li>
          <li>They can also produce <strong>poisons</strong> that deter or kill insects.</li>
          <li>Many medicines come from plant chemicals; for example, <strong>aspirin</strong> is derived from compounds found in <strong>willow</strong> bark/leaves.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Mechanical defences</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Structures with a defensive function, such as <strong>thorns</strong> and <strong>hairs</strong>, which stop animals feeding.</li>
          <li>Some leaves <strong>curl or droop</strong> when insects land on them.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take-home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Plant disease can be caused by pathogens, pests, or mineral deficiencies, and produces recognizable symptoms.</li>
          <li>Diagnosis can use observation, specialist testing (microscopy/antigen/DNA), or trial-and-error treatments.</li>
          <li>Plants reduce disease using physical, chemical, and mechanical defences.</li>
        </ul>
