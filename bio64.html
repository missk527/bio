<h1>Biology – Land Use, Deforestation and Peat Bogs</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Land is a limited resource because there is only a finite amount available.</li>
  <li>Humans use land for building cities, quarrying, farming, and waste dumping.</li>
  <li>As more land is used by humans, less remains as habitat for other organisms.</li>
  <li>Secondary impacts are knock-on effects that spread and cause extra environmental damage.</li>
  <li>Deforestation means cutting down and removing forests.</li>
  <li>One major reason for deforestation is to clear land for farming.</li>
  <li>Deforested land may be used for raising cattle, growing animal feed, or crops such as rice.</li>
  <li>Biofuels are plant-based fuels that can be burned instead of fossil fuels.</li>
  <li>Deforestation can also happen when trees are cut down for wood, building, or fuel.</li>
  <li>Deforestation is especially common in tropical rainforest regions.</li>
  <li>Fewer trees means less photosynthesis, so less CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the air.</li>
  <li>The process that removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere is photosynthesis.</li>
  <li>Burning forests releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Smoke from burning can suffocate animals and pollute nearby towns and cities.</li>
  <li>Biodiversity means the variety of living organisms in an area.</li>
  <li>Deforestation destroys habitats and reduces biodiversity.</li>
  <li>If habitat loss continues, populations can shrink until species become extinct.</li>
  <li>Peat bogs are wetland habitats where peat forms in the soil.</li>
  <li>Peat bog conditions are acidic and waterlogged.</li>
  <li>These conditions slow decomposition because the soil is too acidic and lacks oxygen.</li>
  <li>Water prevents air (oxygen) from entering the soil.</li>
  <li>Peat is partially decayed plant material.</li>
  <li>Because decomposition is slow, carbon becomes stored in peat rather than released as CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Peat bogs store carbon, helping keep CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Peat bogs are often drained to use the land for farming (cattle or crops).</li>
  <li>When drained, microorganisms return and dead plants decompose faster.</li>
  <li>This releases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Burning peat or exposing it to oxygen causes stored carbon to be released as CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Peat is sometimes used as a fuel or in garden compost.</li>
  <li>Peat is a non-renewable resource because it forms much more slowly than it is removed.</li>
  <li>Destroying peat bogs reduces biodiversity and increases extinction risk.</li>
  <li>A carbon sink is something that removes and stores carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Forests act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis and storing carbon in biomass.</li>
  <li>Deforestation leads to less CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, more CO<sub>2</sub> release (often by burning), and habitat loss.</li>
  <li>Both forests and peat bogs can increase atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> if they are destroyed.</li>
  <li>Smoke causes air pollution and can harm animals and humans.</li>
  <li>Habitat destruction removes places organisms live and reproduce, leading to population declines.</li>
  <li>Waterlogged means saturated with water.</li>
  <li>Many decomposers cannot survive or work well in acidic conditions.</li>
  <li>Converting forests and peat bogs increases CO<sub>2</sub> and reduces biodiversity, raising extinction risk.</li>
