      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: definitions of biotic and abiotic factors, examples, and how they affect organisms using the clownfish ecosystem.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Biotic vs Abiotic Factors – Overview</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Biotic factors</strong> are <strong>living factors</strong> that affect organisms or shape an ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Abiotic factors</strong> are <strong>non-living parts</strong> of the environment that affect organisms.</li>
          <li>Both types of factors interact to determine which species can survive and how large their populations are.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Biotic Factors – Definition & Idea</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Biotic factors involve <strong>living organisms</strong> and their interactions.</li>
          <li>They include any <strong>living process</strong> that can influence another organism.</li>
          <li>Examples include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Predation</strong> – one organism eating another.</li>
              <li><strong>Competition</strong> – organisms fighting or competing for resources or habitat.</li>
              <li><strong>Disease</strong> – caused by pathogens that are living organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.).</li>
              <li><strong>Food availability</strong> – how much food is provided by other living organisms.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When you look for biotic factors, think of all the ways animals, plants, bacteria and other living things <strong>affect each other</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Abiotic Factors – Definition & Idea</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Abiotic factors are the <strong>non-living</strong>, usually <strong>physical or chemical</strong>, parts of the environment.</li>
          <li>They can still have a big effect on organisms and whole ecosystems.</li>
          <li>Common abiotic factors include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Light intensity</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Temperature</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Moisture levels</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Wind intensity and direction</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Soil pH</strong> and <strong>mineral content</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Example: Changing Temperature</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Abiotic factors can influence biological processes.</li>
          <li>For example, increasing <strong>temperature</strong> can:
            <ul>
              <li>Increase the rate of <strong>photosynthesis</strong> because enzymes work faster (up to an optimum).</li>
              <li>Lead to a higher overall rate of <strong>plant growth</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For animals, a warmer temperature may mean they spend <strong>less energy</strong> keeping warm.</li>
          <li>They could then use more energy for <strong>growth</strong> or spend <strong>less time</strong> searching for food.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Typical Exam Questions</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Questions often ask you to:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Identify</strong> biotic and abiotic factors in a given ecosystem.</li>
              <li><strong>Explain</strong> what might happen if one of these factors changes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Always think about how a change in one factor can affect <strong>populations</strong> and <strong>interactions</strong> in the ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Clownfish Example – Biotic Factors</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The video uses a <strong>clownfish</strong> living near a <strong>sea anemone</strong> as an example.</li>
          <li>Important biotic factors for the clownfish include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Predation</strong> by bigger fish or eels.</li>
              <li>The <strong>sea anemone</strong> itself, which acts as the clownfish’s <strong>habitat</strong> and protection.</li>
              <li><strong>Competition</strong> for the sea anemone (habitat) with other clownfish or species.</li>
              <li><strong>Competition</strong> for food such as plankton and algae.</li>
              <li>The overall <strong>burden of disease</strong> affecting the fish.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Clownfish Example – Abiotic Factors</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Important abiotic factors for the clownfish include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Water temperature</strong> – can change during the day or across seasons.</li>
              <li><strong>Oxygen concentration</strong> in the water.</li>
              <li><strong>Acidity (pH)</strong> of the water.</li>
              <li><strong>Salt (salinity) levels</strong> in the water.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>These non-living conditions will affect how well the clownfish and other organisms can survive.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Indirect Effects of Abiotic Factors</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Some abiotic factors may not affect the clownfish <strong>directly</strong>, but can still influence it.</li>
          <li>For example:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Light intensity</strong> and <strong>carbon dioxide concentration</strong> affect photosynthesis in nearby species such as the sea anemone or algae.</li>
              <li>If these producers are affected, it will change the clownfish’s <strong>habitat</strong> and <strong>food supply</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>So abiotic changes can cause <strong>indirect effects</strong> on organisms via other species in the food web.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) How to Spot Biotic vs Abiotic in Any Ecosystem</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>To find <strong>biotic factors</strong>, list all the ways living things affect each other:</li>
          <li>Who eats whom? Who competes for what? How does disease spread? What provides food or habitat?</li>
          <li>To find <strong>abiotic factors</strong>, look for all the <strong>non-living</strong> conditions:</li>
          <li>Light, temperature, water, gases, soil, wind, pH, minerals, etc.</li>
          <li>Always decide if a factor is <strong>living</strong> (biotic) or <strong>non-living</strong> (abiotic).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Key Takeaways</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Biotic = living factors and interactions (predation, competition, food, disease).</li>
          <li>Abiotic = non-living environmental conditions (light, temperature, CO₂, water, soil, etc.).</li>
          <li>Both types of factors work together to shape ecosystems and affect individual organisms like the clownfish.</li>
        </ul>
