      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: main organs of the human digestive system, what they do, and how food is broken down and absorbed.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Big Picture of Digestion</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The digestive system breaks large, complex food into <strong>small, soluble molecules</strong> that can be absorbed into the blood and used by cells.</li>
          <li>Main reasons we eat: to provide <strong>energy</strong> for movement and to keep <strong>metabolism</strong> and body processes running.</li>
          <li>Digestion uses both <strong>physical (mechanical)</strong> breakdown and <strong>chemical</strong> breakdown by enzymes.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Key Nutrient Groups</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> – e.g. starch and glucose; main source of energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Proteins</strong> – needed for growth, repair and enzymes.</li>
          <li><strong>Fats (lipids)</strong> – energy store, insulation and protection.</li>
          <li>These nutrients are locked inside <strong>large molecules</strong> in big pieces of food → they must be digested first.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Mouth and Salivary Glands</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Mechanical digestion</span> Teeth chew food to break it into smaller pieces and increase surface area.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Saliva</span> Released from <strong>salivary glands</strong>; makes food mixture more liquid and easier to swallow.</li>
          <li>Saliva contains <strong>salivary amylase</strong>, an enzyme that begins the chemical breakdown of <strong>carbohydrates (starch)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Oesophagus (Gullet)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>After swallowing, food travels down the <strong>gullet / oesophagus</strong>.</li>
          <li>Muscle contractions push the food towards the stomach (this movement is called <strong>peristalsis</strong>, although the word is not stressed in the speech).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Stomach</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The stomach is a <strong>muscular sac</strong> with three key roles:</li>
          <li>1. <strong>Muscular walls contract</strong> to churn food and mix it with digestive juices (mechanical + mixing).</li>
          <li>2. Produces <strong>pepsin</strong>, a <strong>protease</strong> enzyme that breaks down <strong>proteins</strong> into smaller chains.</li>
          <li>3. Produces <strong>hydrochloric acid (HCl)</strong> which:
            <ul>
              <li>kills bacteria in food, and</li>
              <li>provides the <strong>acidic pH</strong> needed for pepsin to work properly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>After about an hour in the stomach, the partly digested food is released into the small intestine.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Small Intestine and Enzymes</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>small intestine</strong> is the main site of <strong>digestion</strong> and <strong>absorption</strong>.</li>
          <li>It produces some of its own digestive enzymes.</li>
          <li>The <strong>pancreas</strong> makes most of the digestive enzymes and releases them into the small intestine as <strong>pancreatic juice</strong>.</li>
          <li>Enzymes here continue the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and fats into very small, soluble molecules.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Liver, Gallbladder and Bile</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bile</strong> is made in the <strong>liver</strong>, but stored in the <strong>gallbladder</strong> until needed.</li>
          <li>When food enters the small intestine, bile is released into it from the gallbladder.</li>
          <li>Bile has two main roles:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="pill">Neutralisation</span> Bile is <strong>alkaline</strong>, so it neutralises the <strong>acidic chyme</strong> from the stomach, creating a better pH for enzymes in the small intestine.</li>
              <li><span class="pill">Emulsification of fats</span> Bile breaks large fat droplets into many tiny droplets, increasing their <strong>surface area</strong> for lipase enzymes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Absorption in the Small Intestine – Villi</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Once food is fully digested into tiny molecules, they are absorbed into the blood through the lining of the small intestine.</li>
          <li>The inner surface of the small intestine is covered with millions of <strong>villi</strong> (singular: villus), which look like small fingers.</li>
          <li>Villi adaptations for efficient absorption:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="pill">Large surface area</span> Many villi greatly increase the surface area, so absorption happens more quickly.</li>
              <li><span class="pill">One-cell-thick walls</span> The surface cells are only one cell thick → very short diffusion distance.</li>
              <li><span class="pill">Good blood supply</span> Dense capillary network maintains a concentration gradient and quickly carries absorbed nutrients away.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Large Intestine and Rectum</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Even after absorption in the small intestine, there is still a lot of <strong>undigested material</strong> and <strong>water</strong> left.</li>
          <li>This material passes into the <strong>large intestine</strong>.</li>
          <li>The large intestine <strong>absorbs most of the remaining water</strong>, turning the watery mixture into more solid <strong>faeces</strong>.</li>
          <li>Faeces are stored in the <strong>rectum</strong> until they are removed from the body.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Whole Process in Order</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Food is taken into the <strong>mouth</strong> → chewed and mixed with <strong>saliva + salivary amylase</strong>.</li>
          <li>Swallowed and moved down the <strong>oesophagus / gullet</strong>.</li>
          <li>Enters the <strong>stomach</strong> → churned, mixed with pepsin and hydrochloric acid.</li>
          <li>Passes into the <strong>small intestine</strong> → mixes with <strong>pancreatic juice</strong> from the pancreas and <strong>bile</strong> from the gallbladder (made in the liver).</li>
          <li>Food is fully digested and then <strong>absorbed</strong> through the villi into the bloodstream.</li>
          <li>Anything that cannot be digested plus lots of water moves into the <strong>large intestine</strong> → water is reabsorbed.</li>
          <li>Remaining <strong>faeces</strong> are stored in the <strong>rectum</strong> before being removed from the body.</li>
        </ul>
