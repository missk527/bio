      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: what fungi and protists are, examples of their diseases (rose black spot and malaria), and how these diseases spread and can be controlled.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What Are Fungi?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Fungi are <strong>eukaryotic organisms</strong>, just like plants and animals.</li>
          <li>They can be <strong>unicellular</strong> (single-celled) or <strong>multicellular</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Yeast</strong> is an example of a unicellular fungus used to make bread rise.</li>
          <li><strong>Mushrooms</strong> are examples of multicellular fungi.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Hyphae and Spores</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Many multicellular fungi have long, thread-like structures called <strong>hyphae</strong>.</li>
          <li>Hyphae grow out from the main body of the fungus and can spread through the soil.</li>
          <li>Sometimes hyphae <strong>spread over plant surfaces</strong> or even <strong>penetrate human skin</strong>, causing disease.</li>
          <li>Hyphae can produce <strong>spores</strong>, which spread easily and grow into new fungi.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Rose Black Spot – Symptoms and Effects</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Fungal disease</span> <strong>Rose black spot</strong> is a disease of plants, especially roses.</li>
          <li>It causes <strong>purple or black spots</strong> to form on the leaves.</li>
          <li>As the fungus damages the plant further, the leaves may <strong>turn yellow</strong> and eventually <strong>drop off</strong>.</li>
          <li>This reduces the plant&apos;s ability to <strong>photosynthesise</strong>, so it does not grow well.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Spread and Treatment of Rose Black Spot</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The rose black spot fungus is usually spread by <strong>water</strong> or by the <strong>wind</strong>.</li>
          <li>One treatment is to <strong>cut off</strong> all infected leaves.</li>
          <li>Another treatment is to <strong>spray the plant with fungicides</strong>, which kill the fungus.</li>
          <li>Infected leaves that are removed should be <strong>destroyed</strong>, so the fungus cannot spread to other plants.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) What Are Protists?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Like fungi, <strong>protists</strong> are also <strong>eukaryotes</strong>.</li>
          <li>They can be single-celled or multicellular, but most are <strong>unicellular</strong>.</li>
          <li>Some protists are <strong>parasites</strong>, living on or inside other organisms.</li>
          <li>Parasites survive at the <strong>host&apos;s expense</strong>, often causing harm to the host.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Vectors and Protist Diseases</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Protist diseases are often spread by <strong>vectors</strong>.</li>
          <li>A vector is another organism, such as an <strong>insect</strong>, that transports the protist between hosts.</li>
          <li>Importantly, the <strong>vector does not usually get the disease</strong> itself.</li>
          <li>The vector simply carries the protist from one host to another.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Malaria – Cause and Transmission</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Protist disease</span> <strong>Malaria</strong> is caused by a <strong>parasitic protist</strong>.</li>
          <li>The protist needs a <strong>host</strong>, such as a human or other animal, in order to survive.</li>
          <li>Malaria is transported between hosts by <strong>mosquitoes</strong>.</li>
          <li>When a mosquito feeds on an infected animal, it can suck up some of the <strong>malaria parasites</strong> in the blood.</li>
          <li>Later, when the mosquito feeds on a healthy person, the parasites are <strong>transferred</strong> to the new host.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Malaria – Symptoms and Dangers</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When humans catch malaria, they can develop <strong>severe fevers</strong> and <strong>bad headaches</strong>.</li>
          <li>People with malaria generally feel very <strong>unwell and dreadful</strong>.</li>
          <li>The symptoms often go away for a time but then <strong>keep coming back</strong>.</li>
          <li>These repeating attacks are called <strong>recurrent episodes</strong>.</li>
          <li>In some cases, malaria can be <strong>fatal</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Preventing Malaria – Controlling Vectors</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The best way to prevent malaria is to <strong>stop the vectors</strong> from spreading the protist.</li>
          <li>We can <strong>reduce mosquito numbers</strong> by destroying their <strong>breeding sites</strong>.</li>
          <li>Mosquitoes can also be killed directly using <strong>insecticides</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Preventing Mosquito Bites</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Another strategy is to <strong>stop mosquitoes feeding on humans</strong>.</li>
          <li>People can sleep under <strong>mosquito nets</strong> to avoid bites at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Mosquito repellents</strong> can also be used to keep mosquitoes away from the skin.</li>
          <li>By reducing bites, we reduce the <strong>spread of malaria</strong> between human hosts.</li>
        </ul>
