<h1>Biology – Drug Discovery and Testing</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Drugs are used to relieve symptoms and help cure diseases.</li>
  <li>Drug testing studies how medicines are developed and tested before real-world use.</li>
  <li>Organisms have evolved useful chemicals over millions of years.</li>
  <li>Many useful drugs come from microorganisms and plants.</li>
  <li>Some natural substances can be used directly as drugs.</li>
  <li>Others must first be modified in a laboratory.</li>
  <li>Painkillers are used for pain relief and to reduce fevers.</li>
  <li>Aspirin was originally derived from willow bark.</li>
  <li>Digitalis is used to treat heart problems such as heart failure.</li>
  <li>Digitalis comes from the foxglove plant.</li>
  <li>These plants became valuable and were over-collected.</li>
  <li>Alexander Fleming was a microbiologist who studied bacteria.</li>
  <li>He noticed a fungus killing nearby bacterial colonies.</li>
  <li>This showed the presence of an antibacterial substance.</li>
  <li>The fungus belonged to the genus <em>Penicillium</em>.</li>
  <li>This discovery led to the first antibiotic.</li>
  <li>Drugs are assessed for efficacy, toxicity, and dosage.</li>
  <li>Efficacy means how well a drug works.</li>
  <li>For example, how well an antibiotic kills bacteria.</li>
  <li>Toxicity refers to how harmful a drug is.</li>
  <li>This includes cell damage and side effects.</li>
  <li>Dosage is the amount or concentration of a drug given.</li>
  <li>Increasing dosage may increase effect but also side effects.</li>
  <li>Preclinical testing begins with human cells and tissues grown in a lab.</li>
  <li>This is quick, cheap, and allows many substances to be tested.</li>
  <li>However, it does not show effects on whole organisms.</li>
  <li>The next stage is testing on live animals.</li>
  <li>Animals are used because their bodies are similar to humans.</li>
  <li>There are two main testing stages.</li>
  <li>The first stage is called preclinical testing.</li>
  <li>The second stage is clinical testing (clinical trials).</li>
  <li>Clinical trials first use healthy volunteers.</li>
  <li>This checks that the drug is safe.</li>
  <li>Researchers monitor side effects and health.</li>
  <li>The aim is to find the maximum safe dose.</li>
  <li>Later trials use patients with the target illness.</li>
  <li>The correct dose maximizes benefit and minimizes harm.</li>
  <li>A placebo is a look-alike substance with no active ingredient.</li>
  <li>In double-blind trials, neither doctors nor patients know who receives the drug.</li>
  <li>This ensures fair testing and prevents false claims.</li>
