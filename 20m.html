    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>What metallic bonding is</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Metallic bonding</b> is the bonding between <b>metal atoms</b> in a solid metal.</li>
        <li>It helps explain typical metal properties like <b>strength</b>, <b>high melting/boiling points</b>, and <b>good conductivity</b>.</li>
        <li>Compared with other bonding types: metals + non-metals often form <b>ionic</b> bonds, non-metals + non-metals form <b>covalent</b> bonds, and metals + metals form <b>metallic</b> bonds.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Structure of a solid metal</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>A solid metal is a <b>giant lattice</b> of atoms arranged in a <b>regular pattern</b>.</li>
        <li>When metal atoms come together, they <b>release their outer-shell electrons</b> into a shared “sea” of electrons.</li>
        <li>The metal atoms become <b>positive ions</b> because they have lost negative electrons.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Delocalised electrons and the metallic bond</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The released electrons are <b>delocalised</b> (free to move throughout the structure).</li>
        <li>There is strong <b>electrostatic attraction</b> between the <b>positive ions</b> and the <b>negative delocalised electrons</b>.</li>
        <li>These attractions hold the lattice together: this is <b>metallic bonding</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why metals are strong and have high melting/boiling points</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the attraction acts in all directions through the lattice, metallic bonding is generally <b>strong</b>.</li>
        <li>It often takes a lot of energy to overcome these forces, so many metals have <b>high melting points</b> and <b>high boiling points</b>.</li>
        <li>That is why most metals are <b>solid at room temperature</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why metals conduct electricity and heat</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Delocalised electrons can move through the lattice and <b>carry electric charge</b>, so metals are <b>good electrical conductors</b>.</li>
        <li>These electrons also transfer energy efficiently, so metals are <b>good thermal conductors</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Malleability: strong but bendable</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Metals are often <b>malleable</b>: they can be bent or hammered into shapes (like thin sheets).</li>
        <li>In a <b>pure metal</b>, the regular layers of ions can <b>slide over each other</b> without breaking the metallic bond.</li>
        <li>This sliding is why metals can change shape even though the bonding is strong.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Alloys: harder than pure metals</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>An <b>alloy</b> contains <b>two or more elements</b> (often two metals, or a metal plus a non-metal).</li>
        <li>Alloys are designed so atoms are <b>different sizes</b>, which disrupts the regular layers in a pure metal.</li>
        <li>With the layers disrupted, they cannot slide as easily, making the alloy <b>harder</b> and less likely to bend.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Example: steel</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Steel</b> is mostly <b>iron</b> with about <b>1–2% carbon</b>.</li>
        <li>It may also include elements such as <b>chromium</b>, <b>manganese</b>, or <b>vanadium</b> to adjust properties.</li>
        <li>Steel’s improved strength makes it useful in structures and vehicles such as <b>cars</b> and <b>planes</b>.</li>
      </ul>
