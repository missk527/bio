      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>What pregnancy tests detect</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Pregnancy tests are cheap, quick, and reliable ways to check if a woman is pregnant.</li>
          <li>Pregnant women produce a hormone called <strong>hCG</strong> (human chorionic gonadotropin).</li>
          <li>hCG is <strong>excreted in urine</strong>, and the test detects whether hCG is present.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Monoclonal antibodies and specificity</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The test uses <strong>monoclonal antibodies</strong> that are <strong>specific to hCG</strong>.</li>
          <li>“Specific” means the antibodies can <strong>bind</strong> to hCG if they meet it.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Two key parts of the test strip</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fixed antibodies zone:</strong> antibodies attached to the strip that <strong>cannot move</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile blue beads zone:</strong> blue beads coated with the same anti-hCG antibodies; these beads are <strong>free to move</strong> with urine.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Negative result (not pregnant)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is <strong>no hCG</strong>, urine carries the <strong>mobile beads</strong> along the strip.</li>
          <li>The beads pass over the <strong>fixed antibodies</strong> but <strong>do not stick</strong> (nothing to bind to).</li>
          <li>No trapped beads → <strong>no coloured line</strong> (no blue strip).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Positive result (pregnant)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>If hCG is present, it binds to antibodies on the <strong>blue beads</strong> first.</li>
          <li>As the beads move, the hCG on the beads also binds to the <strong>fixed antibodies</strong>.</li>
          <li>This forms a “sandwich” and the beads get <strong>trapped</strong> in the test region.</li>
          <li>Trapping many beads creates a visible <strong>coloured line/strip</strong> that indicates a positive result.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Control line</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Many real pregnancy tests show <strong>two lines</strong> rather than one.</li>
          <li>The second line acts as a <strong>control</strong> to show the test has worked properly.</li>
          <li>Typically, <strong>two lines = positive</strong>, but different tests vary, so always <strong>read the instructions</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take-home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Pregnancy tests detect <strong>hCG in urine</strong> using antibodies that bind specifically to hCG.</li>
          <li>A coloured line appears when antibody-coated beads are trapped by fixed antibodies because hCG is present.</li>
        </ul>

  {type:"tf", question:"The test strip works even without any liquid flowing along it.", answer:false, explanation:"Urine flow carries beads along the strip."},

  {type:"mcq", question:"Which best describes the sequence in a positive test?", options:[
    "Beads move → hCG binds beads → beads get trapped by fixed antibodies",
    "Fixed antibodies move → beads stay still → line forms",
    "hCG binds fixed antibodies → beads disappear",
    "Urine evaporates → antibodies change colour"
  ], answer:0, explanation:"That is the mechanism described."},

  {type:"mcq", question:"In a negative test, why do beads not get trapped?", options:[
    "Because urine is too thick",
    "Because there is no hCG to link beads to fixed antibodies",
    "Because the fixed antibodies are missing",
    "Because hCG destroys the beads"

  {type:"mcq", question:"Which statement about different pregnancy tests is correct (from the speech)?", options:[
    "All tests work in exactly the same way",
    "Different tests can work differently, so read instructions",
