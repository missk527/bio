      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Overview of digestion &amp; enzymes</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Digestion changes large, insoluble food molecules into small, soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the blood.</li>
          <li><b>Enzymes</b> are biological catalysts that speed up these reactions without being used up.</li>
          <li>The three main nutrient groups that need enzyme digestion are <b>carbohydrates</b>, <b>proteins</b> and <b>fats (lipids)</b>.</li>
          <li>Small, soluble molecules are absorbed through the lining of the <b>small intestine</b>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Carbohydrates &amp; amylase</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbohydrates are found in foods such as <b>pasta</b>, <b>potatoes</b> and <b>rice</b>.</li>
          <li>The main carbohydrate that we digest is <b>starch</b>, which the body uses as an energy source.</li>
          <li>Starch is broken down by the enzyme <b>amylase</b> into smaller sugars such as <b>maltose</b>.</li>
          <li>Amylase is produced in three places:</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <span class="pill">Salivary glands (mouth)</span>
          <span class="pill">Pancreas</span>
          <span class="pill">Small intestine</span>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Proteins &amp; protease</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Proteins are found in foods such as <b>meat</b>, <b>nuts</b> and <b>beans</b>.</li>
          <li>Protease enzymes break proteins down into <b>amino acids</b>, which are used for growth and repair.</li>
          <li>Proteases are made in three places:</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <span class="pill">Stomach (here the protease is called <b>pepsin</b>)</span>
          <span class="pill">Pancreas</span>
          <span class="pill">Small intestine</span>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Fats (lipids) &amp; lipase</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Fats, also called <b>lipids</b>, are found in foods such as <b>cheese</b>, <b>oils</b> and <b>chocolate</b>.</li>
          <li>Lipase enzymes break lipids down into <b>glycerol</b> and <b>fatty acids</b>.</li>
          <li>Lipases are produced in:</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <span class="pill">Pancreas</span>
          <span class="pill">Small intestine</span>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Bile: production, storage &amp; functions</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Bile</b> is a digestive fluid made by the <b>liver</b> and stored in the <b>gallbladder</b>.</li>
          <li>Bile is released into the <b>small intestine</b>.</li>
          <li>Bile has two key roles:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
1. Neutralises stomach acid
   • Stomach contents are very acidic.
   • Bile is alkaline, so it raises the pH.
   • This gives enzymes in the small intestine their optimum pH.

2. Emulsifies fats
   • Breaks large fat droplets into many tiny droplets.
   • This greatly increases the surface area of the fat.
   • Lipase can now work much faster.
        </div>
        <p><b>Important:</b> bile is <em>not</em> an enzyme, but it helps enzymes, especially lipase, to digest fats efficiently.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Memory tips</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>All three enzyme types (<b>amylase, protease, lipase</b>) are made in the <b>pancreas</b> and the <b>small intestine</b>.</li>
          <li>Only amylase is also made in the <b>salivary glands</b>.</li>
          <li>Only protease is also made in the <b>stomach</b> (where it is called pepsin).</li>
          <li>Remember the pattern:
            <div class="chem">
Amylase → starch → sugars (e.g. maltose)
Protease → proteins → amino acids
Lipase → lipids (fats) → glycerol + fatty acids
            </div>
          </li>
