      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: what viruses are, how they cause disease, and examples of measles, HIV and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What Are Viruses?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Viruses are <strong>not cells</strong> and are generally considered <strong>non-living</strong>.</li>
          <li>However, we usually still treat them as <strong>organisms</strong> in biology.</li>
          <li>They are extremely small – around <strong>10,000 times smaller</strong> than animal cells.</li>
          <li>They <strong>cannot reproduce by themselves</strong> outside a host cell.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) How Viruses Reproduce</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Viruses must get <strong>inside the cells</strong> of another organism.</li>
          <li>Once inside, they use the cell’s own <strong>machinery</strong> to make many copies of themselves.</li>
          <li>When enough copies are made, the virus can <strong>burst the host cell</strong>.</li>
          <li>The newly made viruses are then released and must find <strong>new cells to infect</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Why Viruses Make Us Ill</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>This process of <strong>infecting</strong> and then <strong>bursting our cells</strong> damages our tissues.</li>
          <li>Cell damage is one of the main reasons that viral infections make us <strong>feel ill</strong>.</li>
          <li>Different viruses target different cells or organisms, causing different <strong>diseases</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Measles – Symptoms and Spread</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Disease</span> Measles is caused by the <strong>measles virus</strong>.</li>
          <li>It is spread by <strong>droplets</strong> when an infected person <strong>coughs or sneezes</strong>.</li>
          <li>Typical symptoms:
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>red rash</strong> over much of the body.</li>
              <li>A <strong>fever</strong> – high temperature and feeling very unwell.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Measles can be <strong>very serious</strong> and sometimes even <strong>fatal</strong>.</li>
          <li>In the UK, measles is now <strong>rare</strong> because most people are <strong>vaccinated when they are young</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) HIV – What It Is</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Virus</span> HIV stands for <strong>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</strong>.</li>
          <li>This tells us that:
            <ul>
              <li>It infects <strong>humans</strong>.</li>
              <li>It causes a <strong>deficient (weakened)</strong> immune system.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When we say “HIV”, we are referring to the <strong>virus itself</strong>, not the disease.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) HIV – Transmission and Early Infection</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>HIV can be spread by:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sexual contact</strong>, such as unprotected sex.</li>
              <li>Exchange of <strong>bodily fluids</strong>, for example <strong>blood</strong> when people share needles.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When someone first catches HIV, they may develop <strong>flu-like symptoms</strong> for a few weeks:
            <ul>
              <li>Fever</li>
              <li>Tiredness</li>
              <li>Aches</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>After this, they often feel better and may think nothing is wrong.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) HIV to AIDS and Treatment</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Even when the person feels well, HIV continues to <strong>damage the immune system</strong> over time.</li>
          <li>Eventually, the immune system becomes so <strong>weak</strong> that the person starts to get:
            <ul>
              <li>Unusual or opportunistic <strong>infections</strong></li>
              <li>Sometimes certain <strong>cancers</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>At this stage, they are said to have developed <strong>AIDS</strong> (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).</li>
          <li>AIDS describes the <strong>disease/syndrome</strong> in which the immune system can no longer cope.</li>
          <li>In the past, this often led to death from infections or cancer.</li>
          <li>Now, we have <strong>antiretroviral drugs</strong> that <strong>stop HIV from replicating</strong> in the body.</li>
          <li>If people have early and ongoing access to these medications, they can often live <strong>normal lives</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">Plant virus</span> Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a virus that infects <strong>plants</strong>.</li>
          <li>It affects certain species such as:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tobacco plants</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Tomato plants</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>It does <strong>not</strong> infect all plant species.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Symptoms and Effects of TMV</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>TMV causes <strong>discoloured patches</strong> on the leaves.</li>
          <li>These patches form a <strong>mosaic pattern</strong>, which is why it is called “mosaic”.</li>
          <li>In the discoloured areas, <strong>photosynthesis cannot take place properly</strong>.</li>
          <li>Because photosynthesis is reduced, the plant <strong>cannot make enough sugars</strong>.</li>
          <li>As a result, the plant’s <strong>growth is poor</strong> and overall yield is lower.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Overall Summary</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Viruses are tiny, non-living particles that can only reproduce <strong>inside host cells</strong>.</li>
          <li>They damage the host by <strong>infecting and then bursting cells</strong>.</li>
          <li>Examples of viral diseases include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Measles</strong> – human viral disease with rash and fever, prevented by vaccination.</li>
              <li><strong>HIV</strong> – human virus that can lead to <strong>AIDS</strong> if untreated.</li>
              <li><strong>TMV</strong> – plant virus that damages leaves and reduces growth.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
