    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>What photosynthesis is and where it happens</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Plants must carry out <b>photosynthesis</b> to grow and survive.</li>
        <li>Photosynthesis mainly happens in the <b>leaves</b>, inside subcellular structures called <b>chloroplasts</b>.</li>
        <li>Chloroplasts contain <b>chlorophyll</b>, a pigment that absorbs <b>light energy</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Inputs and outputs</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Light energy is used to convert <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>water</b> into <b>glucose</b> and <b>oxygen</b>.</li>
        <li>Word equation: <b>carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen</b> (with light).</li>
        <li>Symbol equation: <b>6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂</b> (with light).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Energy transfer and reaction type</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the reaction needs energy from the surroundings (light), photosynthesis is an <b>endothermic</b> reaction.</li>
        <li>Energy is transferred from the environment to the chloroplasts by <b>light</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How plants get the reactants</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carbon dioxide</b> diffuses into leaves through the <b>stomata</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Water</b> is absorbed from the soil by the <b>roots</b> and transported to leaves in the <b>xylem</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why glucose is the key product</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The main useful product for plants is <b>glucose</b>.</li>
        <li>Oxygen is produced as a by-product; plants may use some for <b>respiration</b>, but there is plenty in the air.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Five main uses of glucose</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Respiration:</b> glucose is broken down to release energy (like a stored “battery” of light energy).</li>
        <li><b>Cellulose:</b> many glucose molecules join to make cellulose for <b>cell wall strength</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Starch:</b> glucose is converted to starch for <b>long-term storage</b> (compact and insoluble, so it does not draw in water by osmosis).</li>
        <li><b>Amino acids &amp; proteins:</b> glucose combines with <b>nitrate ions</b> (from soil) to form amino acids, which then form proteins.</li>
        <li><b>Oils and fats:</b> glucose can be converted into oils/fats for energy storage, especially in <b>seeds</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Starch storage and when it matters</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Plants store starch so it can be broken back down into glucose when photosynthesis is low (e.g., <b>at night</b> or <b>in winter</b>).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Rate of photosynthesis</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant growth rate often depends on how fast photosynthesis happens.</li>
        <li>Main limiting factors: <b>light intensity</b>, <b>temperature</b>, <b>carbon dioxide concentration</b>, and <b>chlorophyll amount</b>.</li>
      </ul>
