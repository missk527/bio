      <details open>
        <summary>What is respiration?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Most energy for life is released from <strong>glucose</strong> (made by plants in <strong>photosynthesis</strong>).</li>
          <li>Respiration is an <strong>exothermic reaction</strong> that <strong>transfers energy</strong> from glucose.</li>
          <li>Energy is <strong>not created</strong> — it is <strong>released/ transferred</strong> from the chemical store in glucose.</li>
          <li>Respiration happens <strong>continuously in living cells</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why organisms need the energy</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Building larger molecules</strong> from smaller ones (e.g., <strong>amino acids → proteins</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Muscle contraction</strong> so organisms can move.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintaining body temperature</strong> (staying warm in cold environments).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Metabolism</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Metabolism</strong> = <strong>all the chemical reactions</strong> in an organism that keep it alive.</li>
          <li>Many reactions need energy and are often <strong>catalysed by enzymes</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Aerobic respiration (with oxygen)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Occurs when there is <strong>enough oxygen</strong>.</li>
          <li>It is the <strong>most efficient</strong> way to transfer energy from glucose.</li>
          <li>Happens in plants and animals, mainly in the <strong>mitochondria</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Word equation:</strong> glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.</li>
          <li><strong>Symbol equation:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
          <li>This is the <strong>reverse of photosynthesis</strong> (photosynthesis makes glucose).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Anaerobic respiration in animals (without oxygen)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Used only when needed (e.g., <strong>sprinting</strong> when oxygen supply can’t meet demand).</li>
          <li><strong>Word equation:</strong> glucose → lactic acid.</li>
          <li>Less efficient because glucose is <strong>not completely broken down</strong> without oxygen.</li>
          <li><strong>Lactic acid builds up</strong> and must be removed later.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Anaerobic respiration in plants & yeast (fermentation)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Glucose is converted to <strong>ethanol</strong> and <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>.</li>
          <li>In yeast, this is called <strong>fermentation</strong> and is used in industry.</li>
          <li><strong>Bread making:</strong> CO<sub>2</sub> makes air pockets so bread becomes <strong>light and fluffy</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Brewing:</strong> ethanol produced is used to make <strong>beer and wine</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take‑home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Respiration is essential because it provides energy for <strong>many cellular processes</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Aerobic</strong> respiration is preferred (efficient) but <strong>anaerobic</strong> is a useful backup when oxygen is limited.</li>
        </ul>
