      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Overview of the body’s defence system</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The human body has a defence system that protects us from <b>pathogens</b> (harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses).</li>
          <li>We can split this system into two main parts:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Physical &amp; chemical barriers</span>
              <span class="pill">Immune system</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li><b>Physical and chemical barriers</b> stop pathogens from getting into the body.</li>
          <li>The <b>immune system</b> destroys any pathogens that manage to get inside.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Skin – a physical and chemical barrier</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Most of our body is covered in <b>skin</b>, which acts as a tough <b>physical barrier</b> that pathogens cannot easily get through.</li>
          <li>The skin also produces <b>oils</b> and <b>antimicrobial substances</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Skin as a defence
• Physical barrier: blocks entry of pathogens.
• Chemical defence: secretes oils and antimicrobial substances.
• These can kill or damage pathogens resting on the skin.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Because skin is so effective, pathogens often try to enter through <b>holes</b> in the body surface, such as the <b>nose</b> and <b>mouth</b>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Nose, airways and stomach – trapping and destroying pathogens</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>nose</b> helps defend us by having:
            <ul>
              <li>lots of small <b>hairs</b>,</li>
              <li>lots of sticky <b>mucus</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>These trap pathogens and particles in the air as we breathe.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Nose
• Hairs and mucus trap pathogens and dust.
• Reduces the number of pathogens reaching deeper parts of the body.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>If pathogens get past the nose, they must go through either the <b>trachea</b> (to the lungs) or the <b>oesophagus</b> (to the stomach).</li>
          <li>The <b>trachea, bronchi and bronchioles</b> are all coated in a layer of <b>mucus</b> which traps particles and pathogens.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Cilia in the airways
• The airways are lined with cilia:
  - tiny hair-like structures on cells.
• Cilia move in a rhythmic way.
• They slowly move the mucus (with trapped pathogens) up to the back of the throat.
• We then swallow the mucus into the stomach.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>stomach</b> contains <b>hydrochloric acid (HCl)</b>, a very strong acid.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Stomach acid
• Brings stomach pH down to about 2.
• This very acidic environment kills almost all pathogens in:
  - swallowed mucus
  - food we have eaten.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>These defences together make it very hard for pathogens to survive and reach our internal tissues.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Immune system and white blood cells</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Despite strong barriers, some pathogens still enter the body.</li>
          <li>When this happens, the <b>immune system</b> takes over.</li>
          <li>The most important cells in this system are <b>white blood cells</b>.</li>
          <li>White blood cells:
            <ul>
              <li>continually <b>circulate</b> in the blood and tissues,</li>
              <li><b>patrol</b> the body looking for pathogens.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
White blood cells – three key roles
1) Phagocytosis (engulfing pathogens)
2) Producing antitoxins
3) Producing antibodies
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Phagocytosis &amp; antitoxins</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Phagocytosis</b> is a process where certain white blood cells <b>engulf</b> and <b>digest</b> pathogens.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Phagocytosis
• White blood cell tracks the pathogen.
• Binds to the pathogen.
• Engulfs it (surrounds it).
• Destroys it inside the cell.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Some pathogens make <b>toxins</b>, which are tiny poisons that can damage our cells and make us feel ill.</li>
          <li>White blood cells respond by producing <b>antitoxins</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Antitoxins
• Small molecules made by white blood cells.
• Bind to the toxins produced by pathogens.
• Neutralise (counteract) the toxins so they cannot harm our cells.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Antigens, antibodies and immunity</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Pathogens have <b>antigens</b> on their surface.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Antigens
• Substances that the immune system recognises as "foreign".
• Examples:
  - parts of a bacterial cell wall,
  - proteins on the surface of a virus.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Our white blood cells produce <b>antibodies</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Antibodies
• Small proteins made by white blood cells.
• Each type of antibody is specific to one particular antigen.
• They "lock onto" that antigen.
• Act as a signal to other white blood cells to come and destroy the pathogen.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Each antibody only fits <b>one</b> type of antigen, like a key in a lock.</li>
          <li>Once the immune system has found an antibody that binds the pathogen, it starts making <b>large numbers</b> of that antibody.</li>
          <li>The immune system also <b>remembers</b> which antibody works.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Immunity
• If the same pathogen infects us again:
  - our body quickly makes many of the correct antibodies,
  - pathogens are destroyed before they can make us feel ill.
• This is what it means to be "immune" to a disease.
