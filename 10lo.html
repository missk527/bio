    <details open>
      <summary>Overview</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Humans are complex <b>multicellular organisms</b>. A helpful way to study this complexity is to view it in <b>layers</b>.</li>
        <li>The typical progression is: <b>cells → tissues → organs → organ systems → organism</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Cells</b> are the basic building blocks of life and contain subcellular structures (e.g., <b>nucleus</b>, <b>mitochondria</b>, <b>ribosomes</b>).</li>
        <li>Most human cells are <b>specialized</b> for particular jobs (e.g., <b>nerve cells</b>, <b>muscle cells</b>).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Cells → Tissues</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>tissue</b> is a group of <b>similar cells</b> working together to perform a specific function.</li>
        <li>Examples: <b>muscle tissue</b> (from muscle cells); <b>epithelial tissue</b> (from epithelial cells) that lines organs such as the <b>lungs</b> and <b>intestines</b>.</li>
        <li>Plants follow the same layered idea: <b>xylem cells</b> form <b>xylem</b>, which transports water up the stem.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Tissues → Organs</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Different types of tissues combine to form an <b>organ</b>.</li>
        <li>Common examples: <b>heart</b>, <b>stomach</b>, <b>pancreas</b>, <b>brain</b>, <b>kidneys</b>.</li>
        <li>Less obvious but still organs: <b>teeth</b>, <b>tendons</b>, <b>bronchi</b>, and <b>salivary glands</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Organs → Organ Systems</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Groups of organs that cooperate for a broad function make up an <b>organ system</b>.</li>
        <li>Examples: <b>cardiovascular system</b>, <b>digestive system</b>, <b>muscular system</b> (among others).</li>
        <li>Taken together, organ systems form the entire <b>organism</b>.</li>
