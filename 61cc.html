      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Recycling atoms on Earth</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Life on Earth has existed for <b>billions of years</b> because the planet <b>recycles</b> key substances.</li>
          <li>Examples of recycled substances:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Molecules like water (H₂O)</span>
              <span class="pill">Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</span>
              <span class="pill">Atoms like nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Because of continuous recycling, the <b>same atoms</b> can be used again and again in many different organisms over millions of years.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Amazing fact
• You contain roughly 6 × 10²⁷ atoms (about six octillion).
• Many of those atoms have previously been in:
  - oceans
  - volcanoes
  - other animals
  - other humans
• They have been recycled and are now inside you.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Different substances have different <b>cycles</b>.</li>
          <li>In this topic we focus on:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">The water cycle</span>
              <span class="pill">The carbon cycle</span>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Water cycle – evaporation and transpiration</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Imagine an environment with land and water (lakes, rivers, oceans).</li>
          <li>Because it is a <b>cycle</b>, you can start anywhere, but we often begin with <b>evaporation</b>.</li>
          <li><b>Energy from the Sun</b> heats water and causes it to <b>evaporate</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Evaporation in the water cycle
• Liquid water → water vapour (gas) in the air.
• Sources:
  - lakes, rivers, oceans
  - puddles, soil water
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Plants also release water vapour from their leaves; this is called <b>transpiration</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Transpiration
• Water evaporates from plant leaves.
• This adds more water vapour to the air.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Water cycle – condensation, precipitation &amp; return to land</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>As water vapour builds up in the atmosphere, it begins to <b>cool down</b> and <b>condense</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Condensation
• Water vapour → tiny liquid droplets.
• Droplets form clouds high in the sky.
• Winds can blow clouds from one region to another.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Eventually the water returns to Earth as <b>liquid water</b> in the form of <b>rain</b>.</li>
          <li>This falling water is called <b>precipitation</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
After precipitation
• Rain can:
  - soak into the soil,
  - flow into rivers,
  - be taken up by plant roots.
• The water can then be used again and eventually re-evaporates.
• The cycle repeats continuously.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Carbon cycle – main carbon stores</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The carbon cycle is more complex and involves many living organisms.</li>
          <li>A good way to remember it is to think about the main <b>stores</b> of carbon and how carbon moves between them.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Major carbon stores
1) Atmosphere – as carbon dioxide (CO₂).
2) Plants – carbon locked in biological molecules (e.g. glucose, starch).
3) Soil – bacteria and microorganisms in warm, moist conditions.
4) Fossil fuels – underground (coal, oil, natural gas).
5) Animals – carbon in biological molecules (e.g. proteins, fats, carbohydrates).
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Photosynthesis, feeding and respiration</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The most important process in the carbon cycle is <b>photosynthesis</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Photosynthesis
• Green plants and algae take in CO₂ from the air.
• They convert it into biological molecules such as glucose.
• Carbon becomes locked inside plant tissues.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Once carbon is in plants it can:
            <ul>
              <li>return to the atmosphere as CO₂ through <b>respiration</b> in plants, or</li>
              <li>be passed to <b>animals</b> that eat the plants.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Animals also carry out <b>respiration</b> and release CO₂ back into the atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Respiration
• Plants respire.
• Animals respire.
→ Both processes release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Decomposition, fossil fuels and combustion</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When plants and animals die, their carbon-rich bodies enter the soil.</li>
          <li>Two main things can then happen:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Path 1 – Decomposition in aerobic conditions
• Microorganisms in warm, moist, oxygen-rich soil decay the dead organisms.
• They break them into smaller pieces.
• During microbial respiration, carbon is released as CO₂ back into the air.
        </div>
        <div class="chem">
Path 2 – Formation of fossil fuels
• If dead organisms avoid normal decay and end up in anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions:
  - they may be slowly converted into fossil fuels.
• Examples: coal, oil, natural gas.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Humans extract these fossil fuels and <b>burn</b> them.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Combustion
• Burning fossil fuels releases CO₂ back into the atmosphere.
• Burning plant material (logs, biofuels) also releases CO₂.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall, the carbon cycle describes how carbon is continually <b>stored</b> and <b>moved</b> between the air, living things, the soil and fossil fuels.</li>
        </ul>
