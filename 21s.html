  <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

  <details open>
    <summary>Three states of matter</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Matter commonly exists as <strong>solid</strong>, <strong>liquid</strong>, or <strong>gas</strong>.</li>
      <li>Substances can <strong>change state</strong> when energy is added or removed (heating/cooling).</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Particle theory model</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>To explain states, we use <strong>particle theory</strong>: treat each particle like a tiny <strong>solid, inelastic sphere</strong>.</li>
      <li>The model focuses on <strong>spacing</strong>, <strong>movement</strong>, and <strong>forces of attraction</strong> between particles.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Solids</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Particles have <strong>strong attractions</strong> and are packed closely in a <strong>fixed, regular lattice</strong>.</li>
      <li>Solids keep a <strong>definite shape</strong> and <strong>definite volume</strong>, so they <strong>do not flow</strong>.</li>
      <li>Particles are not still: they <strong>vibrate in place</strong> (jostling around their fixed positions).</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Melting (solid → liquid)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Heating gives particles <strong>more energy</strong>, increasing vibration and weakening attractions.</li>
      <li>At the <strong>melting point</strong>, particles have enough energy to <strong>break free</strong> from fixed positions.</li>
      <li>The lattice collapses and the solid becomes a <strong>liquid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Liquids</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Attractions are <strong>weaker</strong> than in solids, so particles can <strong>move past each other</strong>.</li>
      <li>Particles are arranged <strong>randomly</strong> but remain fairly <strong>close together</strong> (still compact).</li>
      <li>Liquids have a <strong>definite volume</strong> but <strong>no fixed shape</strong>; they <strong>flow</strong> to fit a container.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Boiling / evaporation (liquid → gas)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Heating a liquid makes particles move <strong>faster</strong>, weakening attractions further.</li>
      <li>At the <strong>boiling point</strong>, particles have enough energy to <strong>break bonds completely</strong>.</li>
      <li>The liquid <strong>boils/evaporates</strong> into a <strong>gas</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Gases</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Attractions are <strong>very weak</strong>, so particles move <strong>independently</strong> and are far apart.</li>
      <li>Gases have <strong>no definite shape</strong> and <strong>no definite volume</strong>; they <strong>fill any container</strong>.</li>
      <li>Gas particles travel in <strong>straight lines</strong>; “random motion” means their direction changes unpredictably after collisions with <strong>walls</strong> or other particles.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Heating and cooling gases</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Heating a gas increases particle speed: it will <strong>expand</strong> in a flexible container (e.g., a balloon).</li>
      <li>In a rigid container, heating increases <strong>pressure</strong> instead.</li>
      <li>Cooling a gas reduces particle energy; attractions can pull particles together and the gas <strong>condenses</strong> to a <strong>liquid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Freezing (liquid → solid)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Further cooling reduces energy so particles cannot overcome attractions.</li>
      <li>More bonds form, fixing particles into place and the liquid <strong>freezes</strong> into a <strong>solid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Limits of the model</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Real particles are <strong>atoms, ions, or molecules</strong> — not solid, inelastic spheres.</li>
      <li>The model does not describe the <strong>details</strong> of forces (how strong they are or how many act).</li>
      <li>Even with limits, the model is a <strong>useful simplification</strong> for understanding states and changes of state.</li>
    </ul>
