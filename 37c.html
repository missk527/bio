      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Exercise increases energy demand</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>During exercise, muscles contract more often and more strongly, so they need <strong>more energy</strong>.</li>
          <li>Extra energy is supplied by an increased rate of <strong>cellular respiration</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Breathing rate and breath volume increase</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Because respiration needs oxygen, the body must deliver <strong>more oxygen to muscles</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Breathing rate</strong> increases and the <strong>volume of each breath</strong> increases to bring in more oxygen.</li>
          <li>This also uses energy because the muscles around the lungs work harder.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Heart rate increases</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The heart pumps faster to move oxygen to the muscles more quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Heart rate rises</strong>, which also requires energy.</li>
          <li>The goal is to supply enough oxygen to keep using <strong>aerobic respiration</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>When oxygen is limited</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In very intense activity (e.g., sprinting or fast cycling), oxygen delivery may not meet demand.</li>
          <li>Muscle cells then use <strong>anaerobic respiration</strong> as well.</li>
          <li>Anaerobic respiration is <strong>less efficient</strong> than aerobic respiration, but it provides energy when oxygen is scarce.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Lactic acid and the burning sensation</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Anaerobic respiration produces <strong>lactic acid</strong>.</li>
          <li>Lactic acid can build up in tissues and cause a <strong>burning feeling</strong> in muscles after exercise.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Oxygen debt and recovery</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>After exercise, lactic acid must be removed by reacting it with <strong>oxygen</strong>.</li>
          <li>The more lactic acid produced, the more oxygen is needed — this is called an <strong>oxygen debt</strong>.</li>
          <li>Panting after a race helps repay the oxygen debt.</li>
          <li>Blood transports lactic acid to the <strong>liver</strong>, where it reacts with oxygen and is converted <strong>back to glucose</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Investigating exercise effects</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Main measurements: <strong>breathing rate</strong> and <strong>heart rate</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Breathing rate:</strong> count chest rises and falls for 1 minute.</li>
          <li><strong>Heart rate:</strong> measure pulse by placing two fingers on an artery (wrist or neck).</li>
          <li>Exam questions often compare measurements <strong>before and after exercise</strong> and ask you to describe/explain changes.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take-home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Exercise increases respiration because muscles need more energy.</li>
          <li>The body responds by increasing <strong>ventilation</strong> and <strong>heart rate</strong>, and may use <strong>anaerobic respiration</strong> when oxygen is limited.</li>
        </ul>
