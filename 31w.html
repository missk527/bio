    <h2>Notes (rewritten in English from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Immunity and pathogens</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>After the immune system is exposed to a <b>pathogen</b>, it usually develops <b>immunity</b> to that pathogen and the disease it causes.</li>
        <li>Once immune, you are very unlikely to catch the same disease again (e.g., many people only get <b>chickenpox</b> once).</li>
        <li>The problem is that natural immunity often requires you to <b>catch the disease first</b>, which can be unpleasant or even deadly.</li>
      </ul>

    <details>
      <summary>What vaccines do</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaccines aim to give you immunity <b>without</b> you having to suffer the disease.</li>
        <li>A vaccine contains the pathogen (or parts of it) in a form that is <b>weakened</b> or <b>inactivated</b>, so it cannot cause the disease.</li>
        <li>Even when weakened/inactivated, it still has the same <b>antigens</b>, so the immune system responds.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Antigens and antibodies</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Antigens</b> are identifying molecules on a pathogen that the immune system recognises.</li>
        <li>When antigens are detected, the body produces <b>antibodies</b> and develops immunity.</li>
        <li>This prepares the immune system to respond quickly if the real pathogen appears later.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What vaccines protect against</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaccines can work against both <b>bacteria</b> and <b>viruses</b>.</li>
        <li>By the time children start primary school, they have often had vaccines against <b>many diseases</b>, some of which could otherwise be fatal.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Pros (benefits)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Main benefit: protection from catching <b>serious diseases</b>.</li>
        <li>On a population level, vaccines helped control diseases that used to be common, such as <b>polio</b>, <b>smallpox</b>, <b>measles</b>, and <b>whooping cough</b>.</li>
        <li>They also help prevent large outbreaks called <b>epidemics</b>, where disease spreads rapidly and can kill many people.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Herd immunity</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If enough people are immune, a pathogen has <b>few or no hosts</b> to spread to.</li>
        <li>The pathogen can then die out in the population once infected hosts recover or die.</li>
        <li>This indirectly protects people who are <b>not vaccinated</b>, because they are surrounded by immune people.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Cons (limitations and risks)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaccines do not always work perfectly; sometimes they do not give <b>full immunity</b>.</li>
        <li>Some people may have <b>reactions</b> (e.g., swelling at the injection site).</li>
        <li>Severe reactions (e.g., fever or seizures) can happen but are <b>rare</b>, and very severe reactions are <b>extremely rare</b>.</li>
        <li>Overall, the speech states the <b>pros usually outweigh the cons</b>.</li>
      </ul>
