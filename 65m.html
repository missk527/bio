            <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Human impacts and why biodiversity falls</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Human activities such as <b>climate change</b>, <b>deforestation</b>, and <b>waste pollution</b> damage ecosystems.</li>
        <li>The overall result is a drop in <b>biodiversity</b> and a less stable, less resilient ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Two main ways to reverse the trend</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reduce harmful practices</b> (prevent the damage happening in the first place).</li>
        <li><b>Reduce the impact</b> of unavoidable practices and help ecosystems <b>withstand</b> pressure.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Breeding programs for endangered species</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Captive breeding</b> increases the numbers of endangered species to lower extinction risk.</li>
        <li>Animals may later be <b>reintroduced</b> to the wild to join an existing population or start a new one.</li>
        <li><b>Limitation:</b> if the original habitat is still unsafe, the population can decline again after release.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Protected areas and habitat regeneration</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating <b>protected areas</b> helps keep habitats safe so species can survive without constant human intervention.</li>
        <li>Regenerating rare habitats (e.g., <b>mangroves</b> and <b>coral reefs</b>) supports many species and improves ecosystem health.</li>
        <li>Well-managed protection can reduce the need for breeding programs because organisms remain safe in their natural environment.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Making necessary practices less harmful (example: farming)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Some practices are harmful but necessary (like <b>farming</b> for food), so conservation focuses on lowering their impact.</li>
        <li>Governments can support this by <b>laws</b> and <b>financial incentives</b> (paying people to adopt wildlife-friendly methods).</li>
        <li><b>Field margins</b> (strips where wild plants can grow) and <b>hedgerows</b> (shrubs/trees along field edges) provide habitats and food sources.</li>
        <li>These features increase the range of species that can live around farmland, boosting biodiversity.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Government regulation</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Governments may set <b>quotas</b> on activities such as <b>deforestation</b>.</li>
        <li>They can also limit how much <b>carbon dioxide</b> businesses are allowed to release.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What individuals can do</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Recycle</b> and reduce unnecessary consumption to cut the amount of waste sent to <b>landfill</b>.</li>
        <li>Less landfill helps by:
          <ul>
            <li>keeping more land undamaged, and</li>
            <li>reducing the risk of <b>toxic chemicals</b> leaking into the environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why solutions are hard in practice</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cost:</b> protecting biodiversity is expensive, and benefits are often underestimated by individuals, companies, and governments.</li>
        <li><b>Lifestyle trade-offs:</b> maintaining a high standard of living can require environmentally damaging activities.</li>
        <li>Examples include using <b>fertilisers</b> and <b>pesticides</b> to grow enough food, and building large <b>mines</b> for rare metals used in electronics.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Challenges in developing countries</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>People may depend directly on the environment for survival.</li>
        <li>Forest cutting may be for building homes, collecting firewood for cooking, or clearing land to grow crops.</li>
      </ul>
