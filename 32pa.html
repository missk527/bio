      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Medicines (drugs) in modern healthcare</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medicines</strong> (also called <strong>drugs</strong> or <strong>medications</strong>) are a major part of modern medicine.</li>
          <li>Health services spend huge amounts on them (the speech mentions the NHS spending <strong>over £17 billion per year</strong>).</li>
          <li>People are often treated with <strong>multiple drugs at once</strong> to improve how they feel and to treat underlying causes.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Two broad types of medication</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symptom-relief medicines</strong>: reduce discomfort (e.g., pain, coughing) but don’t remove the cause.</li>
          <li><strong>Disease-treating medicines</strong>: target the <strong>root cause</strong> (for example, killing bacteria).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Example: sore throat — treating symptoms</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A sore throat can cause symptoms like <strong>coughing</strong>, <strong>throat pain</strong>, and <strong>headache</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Painkillers</strong> (e.g., aspirin or paracetamol) may reduce pain and ease headaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Cough medicines</strong> can reduce the urge to cough.</li>
          <li>These medicines can help you feel better, but the <strong>pathogen</strong> causing the problem may still be there.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Antibiotics — when they can cure</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Antibiotics</strong> can treat infections caused by <strong>bacteria</strong> by killing them or stopping them from multiplying.</li>
          <li>They only help if the illness is <strong>bacterial</strong>.</li>
          <li>Many sore throats are actually caused by <strong>viruses</strong>, so antibiotics would not help.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why antibiotics don’t work on viruses</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Antibiotics are designed to interfere with <strong>bacterial structures/processes</strong>, which viruses don’t have.</li>
          <li>Viruses also <strong>hide inside our body’s cells</strong>, making them hard to destroy without damaging our own cells.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Choosing the right antibiotic and antibiotic resistance</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>There are many antibiotics, and each one works only against <strong>certain bacteria</strong>.</li>
          <li>Doctors may need tests to identify the bacteria before prescribing the most effective antibiotic.</li>
          <li><strong>Antibiotic resistance</strong> happens when bacteria become resistant, so the same antibiotic no longer works reliably.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Big takeaway</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Modern medicine has been transformed because we can treat both <strong>symptoms</strong> and the <strong>underlying disease</strong>.</li>
          <li>Symptom-relief drugs can improve <strong>quality of life</strong>, while disease-treating drugs address <strong>root causes</strong> and can extend life.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

  "Cannot enter the body"
], answer:0, explanation:"Viruses hide inside cells, making them hard to target without harming cells."},

{type:"mcq", question:"Why might doctors need to identify the exact bacteria first?", options:[
  "Because antibiotics are expensive",
  "Because each antibiotic targets specific bacteria",
