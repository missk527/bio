    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Why organisms need new cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>All multicellular <b>eukaryotes</b> (humans, plants, walruses, etc.) continually make new cells for <b>growth, development, and repair</b>.</li>
        <li>Young organisms grow in size; older organisms replace cells that are <b>lost</b> (e.g., shedding skin cells).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>The cell cycle at a glance</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>cell cycle</b> is a cell’s life from its formation to its division into two new cells.</li>
        <li>Main stages to know:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Growth</b> – cell increases in size and number of subcellular structures (e.g., <b>mitochondria</b>, <b>ribosomes</b>).</li>
            <li><b>DNA replication</b> – the genome is <b>duplicated</b> so each new cell will receive a full copy.</li>
            <li><b>Mitosis</b> followed by <b>cytokinesis</b> – chromosomes separate, then the cytoplasm and membrane divide to form two daughter cells.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>DNA packaging: from strands to chromosomes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>When a cell is not dividing, DNA exists as long, <b>extended strands</b>.</li>
        <li>As division approaches, DNA <b>condenses</b> into compact <b>chromosomes</b> (coiled packages of DNA).</li>
        <li>Each chromosome carries many <b>genes</b> that control characteristics (e.g., eye color).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Chromosome sets and species differences</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Eukaryotic animal cells have <b>pairs</b> of chromosomes—one copy from the <b>mother</b> and one from the <b>father</b>.</li>
        <li>Humans have <b>23 pairs</b> (46 total). Different species have different numbers, which helps explain why most different species cannot produce <b>fertile offspring</b> together.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Chromosome duplication before mitosis</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Before division, each of the 46 human chromosomes is <b>duplicated</b>.</li>
        <li>The duplicate stays attached to the original, forming an <b>X-shaped</b> structure of two identical <b>sister chromatids</b> (the two “arms”).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Mitosis: line up, separate, move apart</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>All chromosomes <b>align</b> at the cell’s center (the equator).</li>
        <li>Spindle (cell) fibers attach from opposite sides and pull on each chromatid.</li>
        <li>Each X is pulled apart so the <b>sister chromatids</b> separate and move to opposite <b>poles</b> of the cell.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Cytokinesis and the outcome</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cytokinesis</b> splits the cytoplasm and cell membrane.</li>
        <li>Two <b>genetically identical</b> daughter cells form—each has the same DNA as the parent cell and as each other.</li>
        <li>These cells then support <b>growth, development,</b> or <b>repair</b> and can re-enter the cycle.</li>
      </ul>
