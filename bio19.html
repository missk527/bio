<h1>Biology - Blood and Its Components</h1>

<ol>
  <li>The components of blood are red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.</li>
  <li>Red blood cells are the most numerous cells in blood.</li>
  <li>Plasma is the liquid part of blood.</li>
  <li>White blood cells help protect the body from disease.</li>
  <li>Platelets help in blood clotting.</li>
  <li>The main function of red blood cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to body tissues.</li>
  <li>Hemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen.</li>
  <li>Oxyhemoglobin is formed when oxygen combines with hemoglobin.</li>
  <li>Oxyhemoglobin is formed in the lungs.</li>
  <li>Oxyhemoglobin splits into hemoglobin and oxygen in body tissues.</li>
  <li>The absence of a nucleus allows more space for hemoglobin and oxygen.</li>
  <li>This increases the amount of oxygen red blood cells can carry.</li>
  <li>A red blood cell has a biconcave disc shape.</li>
  <li>This shape provides a large surface area for absorbing oxygen.</li>
  <li>The cell described is a red blood cell.</li>
  <li>The function of white blood cells is to defend the body against infection.</li>
  <li>Some white blood cells are capable of movement.</li>
  <li>They destroy microorganisms by engulfing or consuming them (phagocytosis).</li>
  <li>Antibodies bind to pathogens and help destroy them.</li>
  <li>Antitoxins neutralize toxins produced by pathogens.</li>
  <li>White blood cells make up less than 1% of blood.</li>
  <li>White blood cells act by phagocytosis, producing antibodies, and producing antitoxins.</li>
  <li>Platelets are small fragments of cells.</li>
  <li>Platelets do not have a nucleus.</li>
  <li>Platelets act when there is a cut or injury.</li>
  <li>This process is called clotting.</li>
  <li>Clotting stops bleeding and prevents microorganisms from entering the body.</li>
  <li>It works by sealing the wound and blocking entry.</li>
  <li>Plasma is pale straw-colored.</li>
  <li>Plasma makes blood watery so it can flow easily.</li>
  <li>Cells suspended in plasma include red blood cells and white blood cells (or platelets).</li>
  <li>Plasma transports nutrients such as glucose and amino acids.</li>
  <li>Plasma also carries waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.</li>
  <li>Plasma transports hormones, proteins, antibodies, and antitoxins.</li>
  <li>The average adult has about 5 liters of blood.</li>
  <li>Blood loss can occur due to knife wounds or surgical complications.</li>
  <li>Saline solution is salt water.</li>
  <li>Saline solution increases blood volume so the heart can keep pumping.</li>
  <li>Saline does not contain red blood cells or carry oxygen.</li>
  <li>A blood transfusion is better because it provides red blood cells to transport oxygen.</li>
