      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Bacteria: not all are bad</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When we hear &quot;bacteria&quot; we often think of <b>disease</b>, but most bacteria are <b>harmless</b> or even <b>useful</b>.</li>
          <li>Most bacteria do not interact with humans at all.</li>
          <li>Many that do are helpful, for example:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Bacteria in our intestines</span>
              <span class="pill">Help us digest food</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>In this lesson we focus on the <b>harmful</b> bacteria that cause disease.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) General features of bacteria and disease</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Bacteria are <b>single-celled organisms</b> (unicellular).</li>
          <li>They are roughly <b>100 times smaller</b> than human cells.</li>
          <li>They can <b>reproduce by themselves</b>, without needing host cells.</li>
          <li>Inside our bodies they often reproduce <b>rapidly</b> because there is a good <b>food supply</b>.</li>
          <li>Many disease-causing bacteria produce <b>toxins</b> that:
            <ul>
              <li>damage our <b>cells</b> and <b>tissues</b>,</li>
              <li>make us feel <b>ill</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Salmonella: food poisoning</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Salmonella</b> bacteria cause <b>food poisoning</b>.</li>
          <li>We catch Salmonella from <b>contaminated food</b>, especially:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Infected chicken</span>
              <span class="pill">Other contaminated meat or food</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Often the chicken picked up the infection while it was alive.</li>
          <li>In some countries (e.g. the UK) most chickens are <b>vaccinated</b> against Salmonella, so infection is <b>relatively rare</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Symptoms of Salmonella food poisoning
• Fever (high temperature)
• Stomach cramps
• Vomiting
• Diarrhoea

Reason: the bacteria infect the intestines, so you get "tummy problems".
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Usually the illness <b>clears by itself</b> within about a week.</li>
          <li>Most people just need to:
            <ul>
              <li>stay <b>well hydrated</b>,</li>
              <li>manage symptoms (e.g. have a sick bowl nearby).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Gonorrhoea: a bacterial STD</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gonorrhoea</b> is a <b>bacterial disease</b> and an example of a <b>sexually transmitted disease (STD)</b>.</li>
          <li>It is passed on by <b>sexual contact</b>, e.g. having <b>unprotected sex</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Main symptoms of gonorrhoea
• Pain when urinating
• Thick yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Prevention vs treatment</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>For any disease, think of <b>prevention</b> and <b>treatment</b> as two separate ideas.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Gonorrhoea – Prevention
• Avoid unsafe sex.
• Use barrier methods of contraception (e.g. condoms).
        </div>
        <div class="chem">
Gonorrhoea – Treatment
• Used to be easily treated with the common antibiotic penicillin.
• Now many strains are resistant to penicillin.
• Doctors must use rarer and more expensive antibiotics.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>strain</b> is just a different type or variety of the same bacterial species.</li>
          <li><b>Antibiotic resistance</b> means the bacteria are no longer killed effectively by that antibiotic.</li>
        </ul>
