    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Undifferentiated vs. Specialized Cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Undifferentiated cells</b> (e.g., stem cells) have not yet adopted a specific structure or function.</li>
        <li><b>Specialized cells</b> have distinct shapes, organelles, and roles (e.g., nerve cells, muscle cells, sperm, egg).</li>
        <li>Multicellular organisms need many cell types—like a building needs many materials.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Start of Life & Gametes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>In animals, life begins when a <b>sperm cell</b> fertilizes an <b>egg cell</b>.</li>
        <li>Both gametes are <b>specialized</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sperm:</b> small; delivers the father’s DNA; contains many mitochondria for tail movement.</li>
            <li><b>Egg:</b> large; stores nutrients to start development.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each gamete carries <b>half</b> the usual DNA (haploid), so the zygote has the normal amount after fusion.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>From Zygote to Stem Cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>After fertilization, the zygote divides into a cluster of identical cells.</li>
        <li>These early cells are <b>embryonic stem cells</b>: fully undifferentiated and capable of becoming any cell type.</li>
        <li><b>Differentiation</b> = the process by which cells become specialized for specific functions.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Examples of Specialized Animal Cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Muscle cells:</b> elongated, packed with mitochondria to power contraction.</li>
        <li><b>Nerve cells (neurons):</b> adapted for rapid signaling (covered in more detail elsewhere).</li>
        <li><b>Sperm cells:</b> streamlined for motility and DNA delivery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">In fully developed animals, most cells are fixed in their roles and can no longer differentiate.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Adult Stem Cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Some undifferentiated cells remain in adults—especially in the <b>bone marrow</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Adult stem cells</b> mainly produce different kinds of <b>blood cells</b> (limited potency).</li>
        <li>They help replace lost or damaged cells (e.g., skin, blood).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Plants: Specialization & Meristems</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Plants also have specialized cells:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Root hair cells:</b> increase surface area for water and mineral uptake.</li>
            <li><b>Phloem cells:</b> transport sugars and other nutrients.</li>
            <li><b>Xylem cells:</b> transport water.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Meristems</b> are growth regions that stay stem-cell-like throughout life (do not fully differentiate).</li>
        <li>Small cuttings can be used to <b>clone</b> plants quickly and cheaply.</li>
        <li>Applications: propagate rare species; mass-produce identical crops with desirable traits (e.g., large fruits).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Medical Uses of Stem Cells</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Two key animal stem cell types:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Embryonic stem cells:</b> can become <i>any</i> cell type.</li>
            <li><b>Adult stem cells (bone marrow):</b> limited to blood cell lineages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In the lab, stem cells are <b>cloned</b> to produce many identical cells for therapy or research.</li>
        <li>Existing therapy: transfer of <b>bone marrow stem cells</b> to replace faulty blood cells.</li>
        <li>Potential future therapies (with embryonic stem cells): replace damaged <b>neurons</b> in paralysis; restore <b>insulin-producing cells</b> in diabetes; and many others.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Risks, Rejection & Therapeutic Cloning</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Immune rejection:</b> transplanted cells from another person may be recognized as foreign.</li>
        <li><b>Therapeutic cloning:</b> create an embryo with the patient’s DNA so derived stem cells are <b>genetically matched</b> and less likely to be rejected.</li>
        <li><b>Infection risk:</b> stem cells grown in the lab could acquire a virus and pass it to the patient.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Ethical & Legal Considerations</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Some object to using human embryos due to their potential for life.</li>
        <li>Embryos used in research are often <b>surplus from fertility clinics</b> that would otherwise be destroyed.</li>
        <li>Regulation varies by country; in the <b>UK</b>, stem cell research is legal under <b>strict criteria</b>.</li>
      </ul>
