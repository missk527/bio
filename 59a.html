      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What is an adaptation?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>For any organism to <b>survive</b>, it must be <b>adapted</b> to its <b>environment</b>.</li>
          <li>An adaptation is a feature that helps an organism to:
            <ul>
              <li>survive the conditions where it lives, and</li>
              <li>successfully get food, avoid predators, reproduce, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Examples:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Thick fur of a polar bear (for cold)</span>
              <span class="pill">Large eyes of an owl (to see in the dark)</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Scientists group adaptations into three main types:
            <div class="chem">
1. Structural adaptations
2. Behavioural adaptations
3. Functional (physiological) adaptations
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Structural adaptations</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Structural adaptations</b> are <b>physical features</b> of an organism – things you can see.</li>
          <li>They include size, shape, body covering, colour, and anatomy.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Examples:
• Seals and walruses have rounded bodies with a thick fat layer.
  → Provides insulation in cold environments.
  → Gives a low surface area : volume ratio, so they lose less heat.
• Their grey-brown colour helps camouflage them from predators.
• Polar bears have thick fur and a layer of fat to survive the Arctic cold.
• Brown bears have long sharp claws and strong muscles to catch prey like fish and deer.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Behavioural adaptations</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Behavioural adaptations</b> are about how an organism <b>behaves</b> or <b>acts</b>.</li>
          <li>They are patterns of behaviour that help the organism survive in its environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Examples:
• Elephants flap their ears and spray themselves with water.
  → Both behaviours help cool them down in hot environments.

• Swallows and other birds migrate to warmer countries in winter.
  → This helps them avoid the cold and food shortage.

• Brown bears eat a very varied diet (plants, fungi, fish, invertebrates, mammals).
  → Being willing to eat many food types is a behavioural adaptation.

• Brown bears overeat in summer then sleep (hibernate) through winter in a den.
  → This "choice" of behaviour helps them survive cold periods with little food.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Functional (physiological) adaptations</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Functional adaptations</b> (also called <b>physiological</b> adaptations) are internal processes.</li>
          <li>They relate to how the body <b>works inside</b>, e.g. metabolism, temperature control, reproduction.</li>
          <li>They are often the hardest type of adaptation to see just by looking at the organism.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Examples:
• Many desert animals conserve water by:
  → Producing very little sweat.
  → Producing small amounts of concentrated urine.

• Camels store large amounts of fat in their humps.
  → They can later break this fat down to release water and energy.

• During hibernation, a bear’s metabolism drops very low.
  → This functional change saves energy so the bear can survive winter without eating.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Exam-style question: brown bear adaptations</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Example question:
            <div class="chem">
"The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is found across the northern latitudes of America and Eurasia.
Its diet includes plants, fungi, fish, invertebrates and mammals like deer.
Describe how brown bears are adapted to live in their environment."
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>A 6-mark question typically needs about <b>6 clear points</b> (e.g. 3–4 adaptations, each with explanation).</li>
          <li>You are <b>not</b> expected to know lots of facts about brown bears already.</li>
          <li>Instead, use the <b>picture</b> and text to make <b>sensible suggestions</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Possible points:
• They live in northern latitudes (cold) → thick fur to keep warm (structural).
• Diverse diet → behaviour of eating many food types increases chance of finding food (behavioural).
• Long sharp claws to catch fish (structural).
• Strong muscles to bring down large prey like deer (structural).
• Hibernation:
   - Behavioural: overeat in summer, sleep in winter when it is cold and food is scarce.
   - Functional: lowered metabolism during hibernation to conserve energy.
        </div>
        <p>In an exam answer you would just choose a smaller number of these and explain each clearly.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Extremophiles</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Extremophiles</b> are microorganisms (such as bacteria and archaea) adapted to live in <b>extreme environments</b>.</li>
          <li>They can survive conditions that would normally kill most life.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Examples of extreme conditions:
• Very high temperatures – e.g. hot springs.
• Very high salt concentrations – e.g. salt lakes.
• Very high pressures – e.g. deep-sea vents on the ocean floor.
• Outer space – bacteria have even been found on the outside of the International Space Station.
        </div>
        <p>Extremophiles show how powerful adaptations can be: life can survive in surprising places if it is well adapted.</p>
