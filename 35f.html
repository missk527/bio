  <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

  <details open>
    <summary>What controls the rate of photosynthesis?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Plants must photosynthesise to survive, but the <strong>rate</strong> depends on four main factors:</li>
      <li><strong>Light intensity</strong>, <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration</strong>, and the amount of <strong>chlorophyll</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Chlorophyll</summary>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chlorophyll</strong> is the pigment in chloroplasts that <strong>absorbs light energy</strong> for photosynthesis.</li>
      <li>If a plant has <strong>less chlorophyll</strong>, it absorbs less light and the <strong>rate of photosynthesis falls</strong>.</li>
      <li>Chlorophyll levels vary between plant species, and can also drop in one plant due to <strong>disease</strong> or <strong>stress</strong>.</li>
      <li>Examples mentioned: infection by <strong>tobacco mosaic virus</strong>, environmental stress, or lack of resources (e.g. water / nutrients) that can <strong>damage chloroplasts</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Limiting factors (what we usually mean)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>In exam questions, “limiting factors” usually refers to <strong>light</strong>, <strong>CO₂</strong>, and <strong>temperature</strong>.</li>
      <li>On graphs: the factor goes on the <strong>x‑axis</strong> and <strong>rate of photosynthesis</strong> on the <strong>y‑axis</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Light intensity graph</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>As <strong>light intensity increases</strong>, the rate increases because light provides energy for photosynthesis.</li>
      <li>Eventually the curve <strong>levels off (plateaus)</strong>.</li>
      <li>A plateau means <strong>another factor</strong> (often CO₂ or temperature) has become the <strong>limiting factor</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>CO₂ concentration graph</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>CO₂ is a <strong>reactant</strong> in photosynthesis, so increasing CO₂ can increase the rate.</li>
      <li>The curve can also <strong>plateau</strong> once CO₂ is no longer limiting.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Temperature graph</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The rate rises at first as <strong>enzymes work faster</strong>.</li>
      <li>After an optimum, the rate falls because enzymes begin to <strong>denature</strong>.</li>
      <li>By about <strong>45°C</strong>, enzymes may be fully denatured and the rate can fall to <strong>zero</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Comparing curves on one graph</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Some graphs show <strong>two or more curves</strong> from different experiments.</li>
      <li>Example: light intensity tested at <strong>15°C</strong> vs <strong>25°C</strong>. A higher maximum at 25°C suggests <strong>temperature limited</strong> the 15°C experiment.</li>
      <li>Another example: same temperature but CO₂ is <strong>10× higher</strong> for the top curve. The lower curve is limited by <strong>CO₂ concentration</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How farmers increase photosynthesis (greenhouses)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Farmers try to increase yield by creating conditions for a high photosynthesis rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Greenhouses</strong> trap heat, raising temperature.</li>
      <li><strong>Artificial light</strong> can extend photosynthesis beyond daylight hours.</li>
      <li>CO₂ can be increased by pumping it in or using a <strong>paraffin heater</strong> (releases <strong>heat and CO₂</strong>).</li>
      <li>Greenhouses reduce pests/pathogens; farmers may also use <strong>fertilisers</strong> (minerals) and <strong>pesticides</strong> (kill pests).</li>
      <li>These methods cost money, so farmers weigh <strong>extra cost</strong> against <strong>extra yield</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
