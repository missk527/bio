    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Why classification matters</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Earth hosts <b>millions of species</b>; classification gives us a shared system to name and group them.</li>
        <li>Early naming relied on <b>appearance</b> (e.g., black vs. brown vs. polar bear), which led to <b>inconsistent names</b> across regions and did not show relationships.</li>
        <li>Example: “grizzly bear” is a type of <b>brown bear</b>; “koala bear” and “panda bear” are not true bears in the same family context.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>The Linnaean hierarchy (18th century)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carl Linnaeus</b> grouped organisms by shared <b>characteristics</b> and often <b>skeletal structures</b>.</li>
        <li>Standard ranks (from broad to specific): <b>Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species</b>.</li>
        <li>Names use mostly <b>Latin</b> so scientists worldwide can communicate.</li>
        <li>Example (humans): <i>Animalia → Chordata → Mammalia → Primates → Hominidae → Homo → sapiens</i>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Binomial nomenclature</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Linnaeus proposed a two‑part scientific name: <b>Genus + species</b> (the <b>binomial</b> system).</li>
        <li>Formatting rule: <b>italics</b> both words; <b>capitalize</b> the Genus; <b>lowercase</b> the species (e.g., <i>Homo sapiens</i>).</li>
        <li>Why it helps: unique, concise, and avoids duplicate common names (many “Tom” vs. one <i>Homo sapiens</i>).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Three-domain system (1990s)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carl Woese</b> used <b>rRNA sequence</b> evidence to show deeper splits than kingdoms alone.</li>
        <li>Added a level <b>above</b> kingdoms: the <b>Domains</b> — <b>Bacteria</b>, <b>Archaea</b>, and <b>Eukaryota</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Eukaryota</b>: all organisms with <b>eukaryotic cells</b> (animals, plants, fungi, protists).</li>
        <li><b>Bacteria</b>: single‑celled <b>prokaryotes</b> found nearly everywhere; often called “true bacteria.”</li>
        <li><b>Archaea</b>: prokaryotes <b>distinct</b> from bacteria; many live in <b>extreme environments</b> (hot springs, salt lakes) and are sometimes called “archaebacteria.”</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Evolutionary trees (cladograms/phylogenies)</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Show <b>evolutionary relationships</b> by linking species to their <b>common ancestors</b>.</li>
        <li>A split (node) indicates one lineage diverging into <b>two</b> lineages.</li>
        <li>Relative relatedness depends on how <b>recent</b> the shared ancestor is.</li>
        <li>Example: Birds are <b>closer to T. rex</b> than to bats; bats and birds are still closer to each other than either is to <b>spiders</b>.</li>
        <li>Tree layouts can vary in style but carry the <b>same relationships</b>.</li>
        <li>Evidence sources: <b>anatomy</b>, <b>DNA/RNA</b> comparisons, and the <b>fossil record</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Remembering the rank order</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Helpful mnemonic (Domain to Species): <b>“Dear King Philip Came Over For Good Spaghetti.”</b></li>
        <li>Feel free to invent your own — funny or “rude” lines often <b>stick</b> better.</li>
      </ul>

  {type:"mcq", question:"Koala 'bears' and panda 'bears' are used to highlight that:", options:["All bears are closely related","Common names can be misleading about relatedness","They are both fish"], answer:1, explanation:"Common names don’t necessarily reflect true evolutionary relationships."},
  {type:"mcq", question:"Who proposed the three-domain system?", options:["Carl Woese","Lynn Margulis","Alfred Wallace"], answer:0, explanation:"Carl Woese used rRNA evidence to introduce domains."},

  {type:"fill", question:"Some sources call bacteria 'true bacteria' and archaea '______ bacteria.'", answerText:"primitive", explanation:"The speech mentions 'primitive bacteria' for Archaea (though modern usage varies)."},
  {type:"mcq", question:"Where do evolutionary trees place the newest common ancestor between two groups?", options:["At the root of the tree","At the point where their lines split","Nowhere; trees don’t show that"], answer:1, explanation:"A node (split) represents their most recent common ancestor."},
  {type:"mcq", question:"According to the speech, birds are more closely related to:", options:["Bats than to T. rex","T. rex than to bats","Spiders than to bats"], answer:1, explanation:"Birds share a more recent ancestor with non-avian theropods like T. rex."},
  {type:"mcq", question:"Bats and birds are more closely related to each other than either is to spiders because:", options:["They both fly","They share a more recent common ancestor with each other","They are both nocturnal"], answer:1, explanation:"Relatedness depends on recency of shared ancestry, not flight or habits."},
