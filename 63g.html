      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Global warming vs. climate change</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Global warming</strong> refers to the long-term <strong>rise in Earth’s average temperature</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Climate change</strong> refers to the <strong>broader impacts</strong> of that warming on <strong>long-term weather patterns</strong> (the climate).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>The atmosphere and the greenhouse effect</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Earth is surrounded by a protective layer of gases called the <strong>atmosphere</strong>.</li>
          <li>The atmosphere acts like an <strong>insulating blanket</strong>, helping Earth stay at a <strong>stable, livable temperature</strong>.</li>
          <li>Incoming sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the surface.</li>
          <li>The warmed surface sends energy back upward as <strong>radiation</strong>, which is <strong>absorbed and re-emitted</strong> by gas molecules in many directions.</li>
          <li>This repeated absorb–re-emit process keeps more heat near Earth than if there were no atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Greenhouse gases</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Gases that trap heat are called <strong>greenhouse gases</strong>.</li>
          <li>Examples mentioned: <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong>, <strong>methane (CH₄)</strong>, and <strong>water vapor</strong>.</li>
          <li>The natural greenhouse effect is <strong>essential for life</strong>, but strengthening it leads to warming.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What causes today’s extra warming?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Over Earth’s history, greenhouse strength has increased and decreased many times.</li>
          <li>Right now, the main driver is <strong>human activity</strong> releasing large amounts of <strong>CO₂ and methane</strong> into the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>As these gases <strong>accumulate</strong>, the greenhouse effect <strong>intensifies</strong> and the planet warms.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How much has Earth warmed?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In roughly the last <strong>100 years</strong>, Earth has warmed by <strong>almost 1°C</strong>.</li>
          <li>Without major action, temperatures are <strong>projected to rise further</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Climate change impacts: extreme weather</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Climate describes <strong>long-term patterns</strong> of weather, not day-to-day conditions.</li>
          <li>Warming can make rare events like <strong>droughts</strong>, <strong>hurricanes</strong>, and <strong>floods</strong> both <strong>more common</strong> and <strong>more severe</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Climate change impacts: sea level rise</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Sea levels rise for two main reasons:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Melting ice</strong> adds more water to the oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal expansion</strong>: warmer ocean water <strong>expands</strong>, increasing volume.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Consequences include <strong>seasonal flooding</strong> and, in some places, the <strong>submersion</strong> of islands and coastal towns.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Climate change impacts: ecosystems and biodiversity</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>As temperature and rainfall patterns shift, species may no longer be suited to their habitats.</li>
          <li>Some organisms may <strong>adapt</strong> or <strong>migrate</strong> to better conditions (often toward the <strong>poles</strong> where it is cooler).</li>
          <li>Many species cannot adapt or move fast enough, so <strong>biodiversity may decline sharply</strong> in coming decades.</li>
        </ul>
