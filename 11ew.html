<h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>

<details open>
<summary>Why cells need enzymes</summary>
<ul>
<li>Cells perform many chemical reactions every day, but most reactions are naturally slow.</li>
<li>Heating up cells is dangerous: it uses too much energy, can damage cells, and speeds up unwanted reactions.</li>
<li>A better solution is a <b>catalyst</b> — a substance that speeds up a reaction without being used up.</li>
<li><b>Enzymes</b> are biological catalysts made of proteins.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Structure of an enzyme</summary>
<ul>
<li>Enzymes are long chains of amino acids folded into unique shapes.</li>
<li>Each enzyme has an <b>active site</b> with a specific shape for a specific substrate.</li>
<li>If a substrate does not fit the active site, the reaction will not be catalyzed.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Substrates and products</summary>
<ul>
<li>A <b>substrate</b> is the molecule an enzyme acts on.</li>
<li>Enzymes may break a substrate into smaller products or combine substrates into a larger product.</li>
<li>Enzymes speed up the reaction but are not used up, so they can work again and again.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Lock & Key Model</summary>
<ul>
<li>The original idea: the substrate fits perfectly into the active site like a key into a lock.</li>
<li>This explains enzyme <b>specificity</b>: only the correct substrate fits.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Induced Fit Model</summary>
<ul>
<li>A more realistic explanation.</li>
<li>The active site is not a perfect fit at first.</li>
<li>The enzyme changes shape slightly to fit the substrate more closely.</li>
<li>This helps the reaction happen efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</details>
